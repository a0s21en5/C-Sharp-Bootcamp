# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a way of developing software applications using real-world terminologies to create entities that interact with one another using objects.

Object-oriented programming makes applications flexible (easy to change or add new features), reusable, well-structured, and easy to debug and test.

# the following basic building blocks to build object-oriented applications:

> Classes
>* A Class define the structure using methods and properties/fields that resemble real-world entity.

> Methods
>* A method represents a particular behavior. It performs some action and might return information about an object, or update an objectâ€™s data.

> Properties
>* Properties hold the data temporarily during the execution of an application.

> Objects
>* Objects are instances of the class that holds different data in properties/fields and can interact with other objects.

> Interfaces
>* An interface is a contract that defines the set of rules for a particular functionality. They are used effectively with classes using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism to make applications more flexible.
