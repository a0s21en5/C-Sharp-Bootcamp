# Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a way of developing software applications using real-world terminologies to create entities that interact with one another using objects.

Object-oriented programming makes applications flexible (easy to change or add new features), reusable, well-structured, and easy to debug and test.

# the following basic building blocks to build object-oriented applications:

> Classes
>* A Class define the structure using methods and properties/fields that resemble real-world entity.

> Methods
>* A method represents a particular behavior. It performs some action and might return information about an object, or update an objectâ€™s data.

> Properties
>* Properties hold the data temporarily during the execution of an application.

> Objects
>* Objects are instances of the class that holds different data in properties/fields and can interact with other objects.

> Interfaces
>* An interface is a contract that defines the set of rules for a particular functionality. They are used effectively with classes using OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism to make applications more flexible.

# Object-oriented Design Principles

There are various object-oriented principles and techniques using which you can develop applications that are maintainable and extendable.

> The followings are four main principles of object-oriented programming:

>* Abstraction
>* Encapsulation
>* Inheritance
>* Polymorphism

# Steps for Developing Object-oriented Applications

Developing an object-oriented application starts with the business requirement document.

> Abstraction
>* First, identify essential entities and their characteristic from the business requirement for a high-level view.

> Encapsulation
>* An implementation of abstraction in code. Create classes and their members with appropriate access modifiers to show functionalities and hide details and complexity.

> Define relationship
>* Establish relationships between classes using inheritance and polymorphism.

> Use Principles & Patterns
>* Use the SOLID principles and Design Patterns as and when necessary to make applications flexible.
