# ASP.NET Core

.NET Core is a new version of .NET Framework, which is a free, open-source, general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft. It is a cross-platform framework that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

.NET Core Framework can be used to build different types of applications such as mobile, desktop, web, cloud, IoT, machine learning, microservices, game, etc.

# Why .NET Core
There are some limitations with the .NET Framework. For example, it only runs on the Windows platform.

# .NET Core Characteristics

> Cross-platform:
>* NET Core runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. There are different runtime for each operating system that executes the code and generates the same output.

> Consistent across Architectures:
>* Execute the code with the same behavior in different instruction set architectures, including x64, x86, and ARM.

> Wide-range of Applications:
>* Various types of applications can be developed and run on .NET Core platform such as mobile, desktop, web, cloud, IoT, machine learning, game etc.

> Supports Multiple Languages:
>* You can use C# and Visual Basic programming languages to develop .NET Core applications. You can use your favorite IDE, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code etc.

> Modular Architecture:
>* .NET Core supports modular architecture approach using NuGet packages. There are different NuGet packages for various features that can be added to the .NET Core project as needed.

> CLI Tools:
>* NET Core includes CLI tools (Command-line interface) for development and continuous-integration.

> Flexible Deployment:
>* .NET Core application can be deployed user-wide or system-wide or with Docker Containers

> Compatibility:
>* Compatible with .NET Framework and Mono APIs by using .NET Standard specification


# .NET Core Composition

* CLI Tools: A set of tooling for development and deployment.
* Roslyn: Language compiler for C# and Visual Basic
* CoreFX: Set of framework libraries.
