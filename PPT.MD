# ASP.NET Core Middleware

ASP.NET Core Middleware is a key component in the ASP.NET Core framework that enables developers to handle HTTP requests and responses. Middleware sits between the server and the application and allows you to process requests and responses, perform additional tasks, and modify the behavior of the application.

Middleware components are organized into a pipeline, which is a sequence of components that process an HTTP request. Each component in the pipeline can perform specific operations such as authentication, logging, error handling, routing, and more.

When a request is received by an ASP.NET Core application, it passes through the middleware pipeline, and each middleware component has the opportunity to examine or modify the request and response. The middleware components can perform tasks such as authentication and authorization checks, request transformation, logging, caching, compression, and other custom operations.

Middleware components can be added to the pipeline in the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class. The order in which the components are added determines the order in which they are executed.

Some common uses of middleware include authentication, authorization, request transformation, logging, caching, and compression. You can also create custom middleware components to implement specific functionality for your application.

The flexibility and extensibility provided by ASP.NET Core Middleware make it a powerful tool for handling HTTP requests and responses in an ASP.NET Core application.
