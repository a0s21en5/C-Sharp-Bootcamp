# RDBMS

* RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.

* RDBMS is a program used to maintain a relational database.

* RDBMS uses SQL queries to access the data in the database.

# Database Table

* A table is a collection of related data entries, and it consists of columns and rows.

* A column holds specific information about every record in the table.

* A record (or row) is each individual entry that exists in a table.

# Relational Database

> A relational database defines database relationships in the form of tables. The tables are related to each other - based on data common to each.

# SQL

* SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases.

* SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.

# Note 

> SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

> Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

# SELECT

The ```SELECT``` statement is used to select data from a database.
The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

```
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
